Every morning starts with a ritual—black coffee and a fresh commit. From Rajshahi to New York, my path blends engineering discipline with a passion for secure, scalable tech.

I'm Amit Biswas, a DevOps and iOS engineer focused on automation, platform security, and intuitive mobile experiences. Whether deploying secure AI workloads with Terraform and Kubernetes or building high-impact iOS features, I bridge infrastructure and user experience.

I’ve contributed to products like YouTube iOS (Google), telematics at Progressive, secure delivery infra at Amazon Flex, and AI-powered tools at GitHub Copilot. Outside work, I lead side projects and mentor emerging engineers.

This repo documents my work across DevSecOps, mobile, cloud, and AI. Let’s build.

## 🌱 The AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional
I have recently completed the AWS DevOps Professional certification, marking a significant milestone in my journey with AWS cloud technologies. This achievement has deepened my expertise in implementing and managing complex DevOps solutions on AWS, including continuous integration and delivery, infrastructure as code, and automated deployments. My tech stack now includes a robust set of tools such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, S3, Lamda, Amazon Lex, Glacier which I’m eager to leverage in developing scalable and efficient cloud-based solutions.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- I'm currently focused on deepening my expertise in AI security, platform hardening, and infrastructure security. This includes learning how to secure LLM pipelines, implement robust model governance, and build threat-resistant cloud environments. I'm also diving into compliance frameworks like SOX, SOC 2, and PCI DSS, ensuring the systems I architect not only scale—but stay secure and audit-ready. This journey is sharpening my understanding of secure DevOps and the evolving field of responsible AI.

## ⚡ Fun facts

- Life, for me, is a canvas of varied hues—photography, music, sports, and the endless quest for knowledge. Whether capturing a fleeting moment through my lens, strumming the guitar, or diving into the latest tech innovation, each day is a step towards learning and growth. I've always believed in making connections, exploring the world, and embracing every experience with an open heart.
- The first programming language I learned was C which I almost never use anymore. 
- I am not a dessert person, but I believe in 2 bites of Cheesecake in some memorable moments.
- I am a big fragrance lover, John Vervathos (Artisan Blue) is my favorite perfume, It smells like I just had a fresh shower with an expensive soap with citrus and ginger.
