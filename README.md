Every morning begins with a simple ritual—a mug of black coffee, a reminder of the new possibilities each day holds. From the vibrant streets of Rajshahi to the peaceful shores of New York, my journey is a tale of dreams pursued and challenges overcome. My name is Amit Biswas, a tech enthusiast whose life is woven with codes and creativity. With over eight years of shaping the future at companies like Google and Amazon, I've lived the reality that passion, paired with hard work, can turn visions into achievements.


My story is not just about the apps I've developed or the projects I've led; it's about the journey, the people I've met along the way, and the lives we've touched together. It's a testament to the belief that with perseverance and passion, the possibilities are endless.

This stage is just the beginning, setting the groundwork for the advanced concepts I'll explore as I progress through the Data Science course. It's a journey towards building a robust foundation in data science, and I'm eager to unlock the potential that lies in data.
